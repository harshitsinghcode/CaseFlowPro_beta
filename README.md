## Getting Started 🛠️

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
  
- Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

- You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

- The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
